          <h3>Podcast Website</h3>
          <p>This was a personal project for a Hackathon.<br>
          The goal of the hackathon was to learn a new language and build anything you want. I built a podcast website
          with links to all listening platforms and social media accounts. I also included a section for the hosts and
          an episode slideshow where each image shows a description when you hover over and includes the audio for the
         podcast episode. I also added a contact form that emails the form using php to the recipient when submitted.</p>

          <h3>Bill Splitter App</h3>
          <p>This was a personal project to practice using JavaScript.<br>I built this bill splitter web app that allows the user to split multiple bills evenly or customize the split.
            At the end of it, when the user decides to settle the bill, it outputs the directions on which users pay the other users and how much so that everyone pays the correct amount.
            I used a linked list data structure where each node contains the username, total amount paid and total amount consumed. I also used local storage to store the data so that the browser can be closed and refreshed
             without losing the data.

          <h3>Circular LL with Garbage Collector</h3>
          <p>This project was for a Data Structures and Algorithms class.<br>
          The goal of this project was to create a circular linked list data structure where each node would be an item
          available at a bakery and empty nodes would be added to a stack to be reused.<br>Code is available upon request.</p>
